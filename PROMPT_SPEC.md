## Prompt Specification

This prompt specification is designed to be all that is needed to write the code for the "VoiceMouse Controller" project.

### Project Goal

Create an Android app that allows users to control their mouse pointer on a Windows computer using voice pitch for horizontal movement and volume for vertical movement, with specific constraints and real-time feedback.

### Detailed Specifications

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Configurable minimum, maximum, and default values for pitch and volume.
   - The app should allow users to set these values within a reasonable range.
   - The pointer should move proportionally to the detected pitch and volume levels.

2. **Connectivity Options:**
   - **USB Cable:** The phone should act as a mouse pointer when connected to a Windows computer via a USB cable.
   - **Bluetooth:** Preferably, the phone should be able to connect wirelessly to the computer via Bluetooth to control the mouse pointer.

3. **Real-time Feedback:**
   - Display real-time feedback of the current pitch and volume levels on the app interface.
   - Provide visual indicators to help users calibrate and understand their pitch and volume levels.
   - Include a real-time cursor position display on the app for user reference.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The app should have a modern and intuitive interface.
   - Use a visually appealing and modern font.
   - Ensure the interface is optimized for both smartphones and tablets.
   - Include a description at the top of the app explaining the purpose and functionality of the tool.
   - Provide easy-to-use controls for setting up and calibrating the pitch and volume values.

5. **Design Requirements:**
   - The app should look professional and modern.
   - Ensure the design is user-friendly and accessible.
   - Optimize the app for dark mode.
   - Ensure compatibility with a wide range of Android devices.

6. **Additional Details:**
   - The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly.
   - Ensure the app provides a seamless and responsive experience.
   - Include a help section with instructions and troubleshooting tips.
